# Ground Station Mission Control Dashboard for AUSTSat
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A real-time web dashboard for the AUST Nano Satellite project, designed to monitor environmental data, stability, and camera feed from a ground station running on a Raspberry Pi. This application uses React for the frontend and Firebase Realtime Database for live data synchronization.

## Features

-   **Live Dashboard:** A real-time overview of the most critical ground station metrics.
-   **Environmental Monitoring:** Live charts and status cards for Temperature, Humidity, and Barometric Pressure from the Sense HAT.
-   **Stability & Orientation:**
    -   A dedicated status card showing the total G-force to monitor physical stability.
    -   A 3D visualizer displaying the station's live orientation (Yaw, Pitch, Roll).
    -   A live compass dial showing the magnetic heading.
-   **Live Camera Feed:** Displays the latest image captured by the station's camera, with an expandable modal showing detailed telemetry for that specific moment.
-   **Historical Gallery:** A complete, chronological gallery of all images captured, with the ability to view the full sensor data for each image.
-   **Data Analysis Page:** Historical charts visualizing sensor trends over time, allowing for deeper analysis of all captured data logs.
-   **Responsive Design:** Fully usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## The Hardware Component (The Ground Station)

This web application is the frontend for a physical hardware setup. The data is generated by a **Raspberry Pi** equipped with:

-   A **Sense HAT:** Provides all environmental and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) data:
    -   Temperature, Pressure, Humidity
    -   Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer (Compass)
-   A **Pi Camera Module:** Captures images for the observation feed.

A Python script runs on the Raspberry Pi, continuously reading sensor data, capturing images, and uploading the compiled data packet to the Firebase Realtime Database.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:**
    -   [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) (with Vite)
    -   [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
    -   [**Recharts**](https://recharts.org/) for historical data charts
    -   [**Lucide React**](https://lucide.dev/) for icons
-   **Backend / Database:**
    -   [**Firebase Realtime Database**](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database) for live data storage and synchronization.
-   **Deployment:**
    -   [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/) for continuous deployment and hosting.
    -   [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) for version control.

## Local Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abrar-khan-alvi/AUSTSat_Frontend.git
    cd AUSTSat_Frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add your Firebase project configuration. **This file should not be committed to Git.**

    ```
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL="YOUR_DATABASE_URL"
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the URL provided in your terminal) to view it in the browser.

## Deployment

This project is set up for easy deployment with **Vercel**.

1.  **Push to GitHub:** After cloning and setting up the project, push your code to your own GitHub repository.
2.  **Import to Vercel:** Import your GitHub repository into Vercel. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Vite/React project.
3.  **Add Environment Variables:** In the Vercel project settings, add the same environment variables from your `.env.local` file. This is a crucial step for the deployed version to connect to your Firebase database.
4.  **Deploy:** Vercel will build and deploy the project. Any subsequent pushes to the `main` branch on GitHub will trigger automatic redeployments.
